# POO Inheritance & Polymorphism Exercises 

## Description
In this task, we will learn to work with Java's error management system 
through the use of exceptions. The main objective is to provide applications 
with robustness, preventing them from breaking when faced with common errors 
such as incorrect inputs or access to non-existent data.
  
## Exercise Statement
Level 1: Custom exceptions and error control.
- Create a custom exception and know how to throw and catch it.
- Work with collections (ArrayList<Product>) and perform calculations on data.
- Detect and handle common errors such as IndexOutOfBoundsException.

Level 2: Safe keyboard input
- Learn to catch and handle exceptions when entering data via keyboard.
- Prevent the application from closing due to user input errors.
- Practice with standard (InputMismatchException) and custom exceptions.
- Reinforce the use of static methods to facilitate code reuse.

Level 3: Cinema bookings
- Design an application based on multiple classes that collaborate with each other.
- Work with dynamic collections like ArrayList.
- Create and manage custom (unchecked) exceptions in Java.
- Apply good practices for user input validation.
- Use methods such as equals() and toString() to work with objects.
- Interact with the user via the console in a robust manner.

## Features
- Capture and handling of standard exceptions such as InputMismatchException or 
IndexOutOfBoundsException.
- Creation of custom exceptions to better manage errors specific to the 
application’s domain.
- Validation of user input, with the goal of creating safer and more user-friendly 
interfaces.
- Separation of responsibilities, dividing the code into classes that handle 
different parts of the application’s behavior.
- Application of good programming practices: clear naming, reusable methods, 
and proper error handling.
